## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **`/api/v1` direct-service routing (ENG-4946).** As the REST gateway is
  retired (ENG-4740), the migrated market-data and account/trading routes now
  target each backend service directly under an `/api/v1` prefix at the host
  root (`https://exchange.nexus.xyz`) instead of the `…/api/exchange` gateway.
  The HMAC signature now covers the full path including the prefix (e.g.
  `/api/v1/orders`). Public method names and signatures are unchanged. Routes
  with no `/api/v1` equivalent yet (`GET /markets`, `/health`, ADL history,
  `GET /orders/{id}`, deposits, keys/agents, WS tokens, admin tiers) stay on
  the legacy gateway. See `endpoints.txt` for the per-route split.

  Pins the Exchange API spec to `v0.6.1` (was `v0.4.0`). **`v0.6.1` is not
  released yet** — it is cut when `nexus-xyz/nexus-exchange-api#41` (ENG-4943)
  merges. Until then the `drift` check validates against that PR's branch; the
  release-tag check is restored on merge (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

- Pinned the Exchange API spec to `v0.4.0` (was `v0.3.5`).

  **Breaking (upstream spec):** `v0.4.0` renames the market summary
  `mark_price` field to `last_trade_price`. The field key in market-summary
  payloads (e.g. anything read through `.raw["mark_price"]`) is now
  `"last_trade_price"`. Consumers reading the raw payload must move to
  `.raw["last_trade_price"]`, otherwise they will hit a `KeyError` at runtime.
  There is no compatibility shim for the old key.
